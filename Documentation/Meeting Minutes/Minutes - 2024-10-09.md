## Meeting Minutes
The team met with Bruce and recapped the previous week with him. We also had him look over our project proposal, and we are in the process of sending him a pull request for him to digitally sign it. The team also broke down our project into subsections. The following subsections for each group member is displayed below.

Ethan Haynes has been assigned the physical design subsection.  
Jacob Brewer has been assigned the circuitry subsection.

Ethan Haynes is the customer for the power management subsection.  
Jacob Brewer is the customer for the front-end design subsection.  
Conner Vick is the customer for the back-end design subsection.  
Layne Bowman is the customer for the physical design subsection.  

The manager role will be assumed by the whole team instead of having individual managers.  


## Action Items for Next Meeting
To do list for the team:  
1. Then specify who will be doing the detailed design for that subsection.
2. Send Dr. Bruce the pull request for him to sign off on.
3. To come up with some crazy senarios for things to go wrong for our tool. The purpose of this is to find outliers, so we can base questions off on and get clarity from Abbey Ward.

Ethan Haynes: Will come up with specifications for the power management subsection.  
Layne Bowman: Will come up with specifications for the physical design subsection.  
Jacob Brewer: Will come up with specifications for the front-end design subsection.
