Conner Vick  
Layne Bowman finished the Experimental Analysis testing both the power and memory subsystems.   

## Meeting Minutes
We started Experimental Analysis. We finished up most of our testing and need to document everything and submit it for peer review. We also found a new issue with the board that we are unsure of the causation. We are unsure on if it is a power or grounding issue, and we have tested multiple potential solutions with only one fixing the issue. We plan to look into that issue further this week and determine if it is a design issue or if we have damaged something.  


## Action Items for Next Meeting
To do list for the team:  
1. Turn in Experimental Analysis.

2. Work on PCB design and determine if another board would be possible to fix the issues we have come across.  

Ethan Haynes  
Layne Bowman will look into issue on the board. Unsure if it is a power issue or a grounding issue.
