## Meeting Minutes
The team met with Lochinvar and they answered our questions. They also are going to send us some blower fans and the old fan diagnostic tool. We additionally explained the meeting to Dr Bruce and what new items we learned. Some examples of that information would be we do not have to provide the 120 V single phase power to drive the fan, the electrical isolation is specfically using opto-isolator, and we do not need to have graphs on our user interface. We also as a team explained the specific components we are planning on using.

Tucker Basham has found a possible microchip for the tool and has begun looking into code.  
Ethan Haynes has been learning KiCad and PCB design.  
Jacob Brewer looked into using solidworks software for the design of the case.  
Conner Vick has looked into the specifics behind selecting a display.  
Layne Bowman looked into different power ICs and also figured out how to do circuit analysis in Kicad, and designed a basic PCB.
