## Meeting Minutes
The team met and peer reviewed our whole Conceptual design. The team found minor changes that needed to be made to the atomic subsystems section. The team also went through a round of peer review with Dr. Bruce, he did not see anything appaarent to change. Finally the team has moved back our meeting with Lochinvar due to Abbey Ward being on a travel assignment. The meeting has been moved from 10/16/2024 at 8 am to 10/23/2024 at 8 am.
