Conner Vick is the customer for the back-end design subsection.  
Layne Bowman is the customer for the physical design subsection.  

The manager role will be assumed by the whole team instead of having individual managers.  


## Action Items for Next Meeting
To do list for the team:  
1. Then specify who will be doing the detailed design for that subsection.
2. Send Dr. Bruce the pull request for him to sign off on.
3. To come up with some crazy senarios for things to go wrong for our tool. The purpose of this is to find outliers, so we can base questions off on and get clarity from Abbey Ward.

Tucker Basham: Will come up with specifications for the circuitry subsection.
Ethan Haynes: Will come up with specifications for the power management subsection.
Layne Bowman: Will come up with specifications for the physical design subsection.
Jacob Brewer: Will come up with specifications for the front-end design subsection.
