Get more details on the characteristics in terms of data points for these graphs. All of the scale (3 million or 3 points)
Come up with some crazy senarios, all of the ways it can go wrong and then go back to Abbey to get some more information. (These are big pictures then go into the more detail stuff) Throw the block diagram on the screen and just come up with what if scenario.  

Write a list of requirements that the tool needs to be and send it over to Abbey. Requirements are the big picture and using the basic knowledge and turning that basic knowledge into techincal details.  

Dr. Bruce is good with the Project Proposal. Ask Micah whats he wants from Bruce.  

Bruce would like us to hopefully have a "working Prototype" at least demonstrates the majority of the project to help him sleep better at night over the break. Talk with Micah on buying our parts early.  

So we need to design the PCB early and see if we can get them printed out, and see what we can do. Even if we need to display it on a PC or something like that.  

Have Bruce review the Project Proposal through Github.



## Key Points
1. Getting Dr. Bruce's Github username, and sending him a review to approve of the project proposal.

2. Created a draft block diagram to break up our problem into smaller subsections.

3. Gave specific sections of the conceptual design to the team members.

2. Micah has approved the project proposal.
