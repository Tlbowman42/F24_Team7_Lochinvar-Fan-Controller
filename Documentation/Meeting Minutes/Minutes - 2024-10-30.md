## Key Points
1. We storyboarded our design. In other words we came up with some possible menu layouts and final layout of all components.

2. We made corrections to our Conceptual Design.

3. Due to one of the comments we had to re-break our subsystems down, so we also redeligated work to everyone.
   
## Action Items for Past Meeting
1. We story-boarded our design on our Monday meeting.
  
2. We also have specific components for our design that may tentatively change.

## Member Updates
Tucker Basham we have updated our microcontroller to the L452.
Ethan Haynes looked into opto-couplers, and learning kicad.
Jacob Brewer started learning solidworks and look into free membership.
Conner Vick found a new character display and put in the preliminary data into the component spreadsheet.
Layne Bowman looked into buck convertor power modules.

## Meeting Minutes
The team completely redid most of our conceptual design. During this we redesigned our Hardware Block Diagram and we have now eight different subsystems. Due to us changing the subsystems we also redeligated work out to everyone and the new assignments are shown below.  

Tucker Basham has been assigned the Microcontroller & Memory subsystems.  
Conner Vick has been assigned the Display & Memory subsystems.  
Ethan Haynes has been assigned the Pre-Processing & the Ports & Buttons subsystems.  
Jacob Brewer has been assigned the Case and Post-Processing subsystems.  
Layne Bowman has been assigned the Power subsystem.  


## Action Items for Next Meeting
To do list for the team:  
1. Work on their parts of the detailed design.
2. Finish the V-I characteristic sheet for components.

Ethan Haynes is going to figure out the PWM amplitude, and will fill in the V-I characteristics excel sheet.  
Layne Bowman finalize the power module chip.  
Tucker Basham try to obtain the nucleo boards for prototyping.  
Jacob Brewer is going to look into solidworks and is going to make a rough model for the top and model of the case.  
Conner Vick looking into coding the menu system for the display.
