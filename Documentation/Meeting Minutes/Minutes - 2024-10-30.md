## Key Points
1. We storyboarded our design. In other words we came up with some possible menu layouts and final layout of all components.

2. We made corrections to our Conceptual Design.

3. Due to one of the comments we had to re-break our subsystems down, so we also redeligated work to everyone.
   
## Action Items for Past Meeting
1. We story-boarded our design on our Monday meeting.
  
2. We also have specific components for our design that may tentatively change.

## Meeting Minutes
The team completely redid most of our conceptual design. During this we redesigned our Hardware Block Diagram and we have now eight different subsystems. Due to us changing the subsystems we also redeligated work out to everyone and the new assignments are shown below.  

Tucker Basham has been assigned the Microcontroller & Memory subsystems.  
Conner Vick has been assigned the Display & Memory subsystems.  
Ethan Haynes has been assigned the Pre-Processing & the Ports & Buttons subsystems.  
Jacob Brewer has been assigned the Case and Post-Processing subsystems.  
Layne Bowman has been assigned the Power subsystem.
