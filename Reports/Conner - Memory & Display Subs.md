# Function of the Subsystem
The goal of this subsystem is to display the options avalible for the user to interact with our tools software.

# Specifications and Constraints

1. The display shall show the PWM signal.  
2. The display shall show the tachometer signal.  
3. The display shall show the different options for the user interface.  
4. The display shall show the correct operations based on the user input. 

# Overview of Proposed Solution
The proposed solution for this subsystem is the use of a character LCD. This will be adequate to show the PWM and TACH signals. It will easily be able to show all the options available to the user and reflect the user's input appropriately.

# Interfacing with Other Subsystems
The Display will interface directly with the microcontroller through a parallel serial connection. This will allow the microcontroller to send the required information to the display, so the display can show the information to the user. It will also require a copper connection to the power subsystem in order for the display to turn on and be used.
