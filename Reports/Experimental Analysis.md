# Power Source Stability and Redundancy Test

## Purpose and Justification

1. To verify the the Fan Diagnostic Tool operates stably when powered by:
 
   - The Fan Control Board (~24 Vdc)
   - USB Connection (5 Vdc)
   - Both power sources simultaneously
2. To ensure power switching does not disrupt tool operation.

## Detailed Procedure

### Setup

1. Connect the Fan Diagnostic Tool to a variable DC power supply set to 24 Vdc to simulate the Fan Control Board power.
2. Connect the positive of the power supply to the 1st pin of either of the MOLEX connections and the negative of the power supply to the 5th pin of either of the MOLEX connections.
