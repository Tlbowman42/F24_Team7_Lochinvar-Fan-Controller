# Power Source Stability and Redundancy Test

## Purpose and Justification

1. To verify the the Fan Diagnostic Tool operates stably when powered by:
 
   - The Fan Control Board (~24 Vdc)
   - USB Connection (5 Vdc)
   - Both power sources simultaneously
2. To ensure power switching does not disrupt tool operation.
