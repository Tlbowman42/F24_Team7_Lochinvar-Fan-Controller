# Function of the Subsystem

The role of the Power subsystem is to ensure stable power throughout the diagnostic tool. Specifically, this subsystem accepts power from a DC bus or USB connection, stepping the input voltage down to a manageable 3.3V DC that will power the tool's microcontroller, display, and all other components. Additionally, this subsystem will offer electrical isolation from the fan controller's Molex connection and the diagnostic tool.
