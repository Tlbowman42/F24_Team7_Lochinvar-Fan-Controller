# Function of the Subsystem

The role of the Power subsystem is to ensure stable power throughout the diagnostic tool. Specifically, this subsystem accepts power from a DC bus or USB connection, stepping the input voltage down to a manageable 3.3V DC that will power the tool's microcontroller, display, and all other components. Additionally, this subsystem will offer electrical isolation from the fan controller's Molex connection and the diagnostic tool.  

# Specifications and Constraints
The power subsystem shall adhere to the following specifications and constraints:

*Specifications*
1. The tool shall be able to be powered by both the DC power bus from the boiler's fan, which is 10 to 40 volts, and by a USB connection if a fan is not present. [1]
2. The Power shall encompass safe and proper Ports between all subsections of the project.
3. The Power shall be able to take in various DC voltage loads (24V & 5V) and adjust those voltages to usable levels (3.3V).
4. The device shall be powered by the fan DC power bus as well as by the USB connection in case no fan is connected.
5. The Power shall be placed in a design such that all I/O ports are properly mapped and subsection Ports are clear and efficient.
6. The Power shall output DC power to the display and microcontroller.
7. The Power shall ensure stable power is output to all sensitive components such as the microcontroller.
8. The Power shall have safety measures in place to deal with noise and surges.

***I may end up taking away some of these specifications depending on what the group consensus is***  

*Constraints*
1. IEC 61010-2-081: The IEC 61010 standard is for the safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control and laboratory use. The specific subsection that we will need to follow is subsection 2-081. This subsection applies to automatic and semi-automatic laboratory equipment for analysis and other purposes. In other words this section pertains to equipment for measuring or modifying one or more characteristics or parameters of samples. [2]
2. The Power subsystem must incorporate electrical isolation for its output due to the presence of 'dirty power' from input sources, ensuring the reliability and protection of downstream components. 

*Justification for Constraints*  

Constraint one is applicable to the Power Subsystem due to the electrical safety concerns for equipment that is used for measurement, control, and in laboratories.  

Constraint two is applicable to the Power Subsystem due to the nature of the DC voltage supply the Fan Diagnostic Tool will be supplied by. This constraint was never written in words; however, through discussion with our customer, Lochinvar, we will need an isolated power output for our Diagnostic Tool.  

# Overview of Proposed Solution
The Power Subsystem will be comprised of a few main parts:  

1. A flyback converter with one isolated output
2. A diode-oring circuit to allow for two different sources to power the board
3. A LDO voltage regulator to step 5V DC down to 3.3V DC.
4. A reverse polarity protection circuit

First the board will be connected by Molex connection to a controller. This controller will provide 10-40V DC, at a nominal voltage of 24V DC. First the voltage will go through a reverse polarity protection circuit comprised of a PFET and clamping diode. This circuit will ensure that in the case of the Vdd and Gnd getting swapped the circuit will not be damaged.  

Second after the reverse polarity protection the voltage will be fed into a flyback converter that will have one 5V DC output that will connect to the rest of the diagnostic tool. This will fufill the second constraint of providing an isolated power supply for our diagnostic tool.  

Third the two 5V DC sources, one from a USB connection and one from the isolated output of the flyback converter, will enter into a diode-oring circuit. This circuit is set up so that the molex connection will be given priority to power the board if it is available. This will fulfill the first specification, allowing for the board to be powered by two different sources.  

Lastly after the diode-oring circuit the voltage will be inputted into an Low Drop-out Voltage Regulator to step down the voltage to 3.3V DC for the rest of the components on the board.  

# Interfacing with Other Subsystems
1. Microcontroller
   - The Microcontroller subsystem will receive an input power signal from the Power subsystem. The voltage will initially come from a Molex connection from the boiler controller or to from the USB. This will either be 24V DC or 5V DC respectively. The Power subsystem will then step down the voltage to a useable 3.3V for the microcontroller. It will additionally provide electrical isolation between the USB and Molex connector through the use of an opto-isolator. Therefore the Power subsystem will be outputting a 3.3V DC power signal.

2. Display
   - The Display subsystem will also receive the same 3.3V DC power signal the microcontroller subsystem receives from the Power subsystem. Therefore this signal will also be electrically isolated from any power surges. Finally, the Power subsystem will be outputting a 3.3V DC power signal.

3. Case
   - The Case and Power subsystems are not connected.

4. Pre-Processing
   - The Pre-Processing will recieve the same 3.3V DC power signal the microcontroller subsystem receives from the Power subsystem. Therefore this signal will also be electrically isolated from any power surges. Finally, the Power subsystem will be outputting a 3.3V DC power signal. ***The Pre-Processing may need to be updated due to the current design of the optocouplers pulling up to 3.3 and 24V***  

5. Post-processing
   - The Post-Processing will recieve the same 3.3V DC power signal the microcontroller subsystem receives from the Power subsystem. Therefore this signal will also be electrically isolated from any power surges. Finally, the Power subsystem will be outputting a 3.3V DC power signal. ***The Post-Processing may need to be updated due to the current design of the optocouplers pulling up to 3.3 and 24V***  

6. Memory
   - The Memory and Power subsystems are not connected.

7. Ports and Buttons
   - The Ports and Buttons subsystem is directly connected to the Power subsystem. Specifically the Molex and USB Ports providing the 24V DC and 5V DC needed to power the tool. Therefore the Ports and Buttons subsystem will be outputting the DC power signals to the Power Subsystem, in other words the DC voltage will be an input to the Power subsystem.

# Analysis

I will split my analysis into three main parts.  

1. Analysis over the Reverse Polarity Protection Circuit
2. Analysis over the Flyback Converter with an Isolated Output
3. Analysis over the Diode-oring Circuit and the LDO Voltage Regulator

## Analysis over the Reverse Polarity Protection Circuit

I have shown my Ltspice circuit diagram below. The simulation is stepping through source voltages, it will step from the voltage source being +10 volts to it being +40 volts in steps of one. I am then measuring the voltage after the PFET (V_pol), and this voltage will be what is given to the flyback converter. The results of this simulation can be found in the text document labeled "Polarity Checker Error Log (Positive Voltage)", or I have also shown the transient graphs below.  

Comparing the first two graphs titled "Transient Graph for V_pol (Positive Source)" and "Transient Graph for V_pol (Negative Source)" we observe the following: 

1. When the source voltage is positive the flyback converter will be recieving the voltage given by the molex connecter. This is due to the Vgs or threshold voltage being high enough for the PMOS to be in the saturation region.
2. When the source voltage is negative the flyback converter will be recieving little to no voltage since the PFET will open due to its Vgs voltage not being high enough. The voltage that does get through is the result of leakage and because the Vgs value is hovering close enough to the threshold voltage of -2 to -4 volts for the IRF9540NPBF PMOS.

Comparing the second two graphs titled "Transient Graph for Vg - V_pol (Positive Source)" and "Transient Graph for Vg - V_pol (Negative Source)" we observe the following: 

1. The diode will clamp the Vgs voltage to around -13V when needed. The reason for this is to not violate the Vgs rating for the IRF9540NPBF PMOS which is plus or minus 20 volts.
2. If the source is negative the Vgs voltage will not be in the threshold region of -2V to -4V therefore the PMOS will be acting in the cutoff region.

Therefore this circuit helps to achieve constraint one, due to allowing for a more electrically safe circuit due to polarities not being reversed.

## Analysis over the Flyback Converter with an Isolated Output

I am using the LM5180EVM-S05 Flyback Converter for our design. The purpose of this flyback converter is to step down our 10-40V DC source from the fan controller and output an isolated 5V DC for our diagnostic tool. The datasheet states, " The LM5180-Q1 single-output EVM is designed to use a regulated or non-regulated high-voltage input rail ranging from 10 V to 65 V to produce a tightly-regulated, isolated output voltage of 5V at load currents of 1 A(or higher depending on VIN)." [4] 

As shown in the image below the Vin can be from 10V to 65V with a nominal voltage of 24V, which also aligns with the nominal voltage of the controller voltage that we will be provided. This voltage will then be stepped down to 4.95V to 5.1V with a nominal voltage of 5.025V. I have also shown the Kicad schematic downloaded from Texas Instruments website for reference. [5]

The flyback converter shown above will also achieve constraint 1. By allowing our diagnostic tool to be electrically isolated from the "dirty" power supply.  

## Analysis over the Diode-oring Circuit and the LDO Voltage Regulator

Since our design should incorporate being powered by two different sources, I choose a diode-oring circuit. The circuit is comprised of the 5.025 nominal DC voltage from the flyback converter, a schottky diode, a standard diode, and the 5V DC coming from the USB. As shown below in the circuit diagram the flyback converter is connected to the anode end of the schottky diode, and the USB 5V is connected to the anode of the standard diode. Then the two cathodes are connected together. In this connection the diode-oring circuit will output the highest voltage on the cathode end. Since I am using a schottky diode for the molex connection (coming out of the flyback converter) the molex connection if connected will have the priority to power the board. If the molex connection is not available then the USB 5V will be higher and therefore power the board. 

Next the output of the diode-oring circuit is then inputted into the TPS79633DCQR LDO Voltage Regulator. As shown on the datasheet the Vin value for the TPS79633DCQR LDO is from 2.7 to 5.5 volts. In the case the molex connector is chosen by the diode circuit the Vin would be approximately 4.7V and if the USB connection is chosen the Vin is approximately 4.3V. Therefore the Vin parameter should not be violated. Additionally, the TPS79633DCQR model is specifically designed to output 3.3V at 1A max. Therefore the LDO should be able to provide enough current and voltage to all the components in the 3.3V circuit.

The diode-oring circuit will allow us to power the board through two different sources. It will also give us a managable 3.3V for our smaller components to run off.
