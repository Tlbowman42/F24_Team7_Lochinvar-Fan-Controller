# Lochinvar Fan Controller
## Executive Summary

Give the elevator pitch and abstract for the project. It should allow interested visitors to broadly understand the motivation for the project and what the project has accomplished.


## Capabilities

The current version of our Fan Diagnostic Tool has the following capabilities:

1. Simulate a boiler fan
2. Generate PWM and Tachometer signals that can replicate boiler fans
3. Save real-time data to output files as well as user and fan configurations


## Salient Outcomes

As the project progresses these are the outcomes we thought were more impressive than others. Listed below are our salient outcomes for this project:

1. Generate any Lochinvar designated fan signal


## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.
