# Lochinvar Fan Controller
## Executive Summary

The Fan Diagnostic Tool is a compact, modular system designed to test, simulate, and monitor blower fans used in boiler control systems. It streamlines diagnostics by offering multiple modes for real-time monitoring, fan simulation, and signal simulation. By improving testing speed and accuracy, the tool helps reduce development time, and enhance product reliability.

## Capabilities

The current version of our Fan Diagnostic Tool has the following capabilities:

1. Simulate a boiler fan
2. Generate PWM and Tachometer signals that can replicate boiler fans
3. Save user-parameters and load back the lastest saved data.


## Salient Outcomes

As the project progresses these are the outcomes we thought were more impressive than others. Listed below are our salient outcomes for this project:

1. Generate any Lochinvar designated fan signal.
2. Load and save user parameters.
3. Interface both with a function generator and the Lochinvar Control Board.


## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.

He then went on and completed his Masters in electrical engineering at the Georgia Institue of Technology and his PhD in electrical engineering from the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.

### Stakeholders

The primary customer for the project is Lochinvar, which is a apart of the AO-Smith Corporation. There are plans for future capstone teams to develop both the Fan Driving mode and the Signal Passthrough mode.

### Recognitions

We would like to recognize and thank Dr. JW Bruce, Micah Rentschler, and our contacts at Lochinvar for their support and guidance throughout this project.  

## Repo Organization

### [Reports](https://github.com/Tlbowman42/F24_Team7_Lochinvar-Fan-Controller/tree/main/Reports)

The [Project Proposal](https://github.com/Tlbowman42/F24_Team7_Lochinvar-Fan-Controller/blob/main/Reports/Project%20Proposal.md) is the intial document for the project where the problem is defined and the goals for the project.  

The [Conceptual Design](https://github.com/Tlbowman42/F24_Team7_Lochinvar-Fan-Controller/blob/main/Reports/Conceptual%20Design%20and%20Planning.md) gives a more detailed solution to the problem as well as breakdowns the subsystems and gives a projected timeline and budget.  

The [Experimental Analysis](https://github.com/Tlbowman42/F24_Team7_Lochinvar-Fan-Controller/blob/main/Reports/Experimental%20Analysis.md) is where we designed and tested our Fan Diagnostic Tool to see if we met our success criteria set out in the Conceptual Design. 

The [Poster](https://github.com/Tlbowman42/F24_Team7_Lochinvar-Fan-Controller/blob/main/Reports/Capstone_Poster.pdf) is where we showcase our final project to advisors, faculty, and the public.

The [Final Presentation]() is where we showcase our time in Capstone to the Industrial Advisory Board.
